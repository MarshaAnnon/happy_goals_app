# Project Title:

Try Something New App

This project is creating a CRUD, MVC app using Sinatra. This is a custom app that is created to track all the new things you want to try &/or experience. Essentially, I built a simple Content Management System (CMS).

This project was completed as part of Flatiron School's Software Engineering course.

```

## The project criteria:

- Build an MVC Sinatra application.
- Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.
- Use multiple models.
- Use at least one has_many relationship on a User model and one belongs_to  relationship on another model.
- Must have user accounts - users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
- Validate the uniqueness of a user login attribute (username or email).
- Once logged in, a user must have the ability to create, read, update, and destroy the resource that belongs_to user.
- Ensure that users can edit and delete only their own resources - not resources created by other users.
- Validate user input so bad data cannot be persisted to the database.
- BONUS: Display validation failures to a user with error messages. 

## Project plan:

- Map out my user flow through my HTTP verbs and controller actions using LucidChart.
- Map out tables, think about the attributes each would need. Then create my tables.     
- Create my models.
- Create a seeds file for my database.    
- Start creating my routes and corresponding views that would take my user on a journey through my app.    
- The design stage, bring the app to life with imagery, colors, and fonts.
